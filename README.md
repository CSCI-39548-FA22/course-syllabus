## Course Description

This elective course is meant to introduce Computer Science students to modern day web development practices, languages, and frameworks that are in use in the industry today to do full stack web development. The course is mostly practical and hands-on to give the students as close to a real-world industry experience as possible. Students will spend the majority of the semester building web applications of varying degrees, from small assignments with initial boilerplate/template code, to building their own web app from scratch as part of a final project.

After the completion of this course, students are expected to have at least a basic understanding of how web application development works, and should be comfortable setting up a basic fullstack web-apps from scratch.
